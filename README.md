# MathCollab

Math Collab is an interactive math editing and collaboration platform that enables real-time collaborative learning of math and other applied math courses. Users can join a class and work together to solve math questions using a clean, user-friendly dashboard. Math Collab does not require special math syntax like LaTeX and instead allows for simple command-based input.

The platform provides a solving and collaboration area, and users can login to participate. Math Collab also includes special functions such as common math shapes and commands, and allows for easy erasing, grabbing, and moving of text and objects.

Math Collab is a powerful tool for creating documents rich with math, as mathematical lines are properly formatted while text lines are formatted as normal. Additionally, users can record both their screen and voice while they solve problems, and collaborators can hear each other in real-time.
Sessions can be exported as PDFs and saved in a tutorial knowledge base for future reference.
